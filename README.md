# Credit Card Fraud Detection System with MLOps Integration

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a Credit Card Fraud Detection System that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. The project will incorporate MLOps practices to ensure the entire lifecycle of the machine learning model is automated and scalable. The project also includes a real-time dashboard for visualizing fraud detection insights.
Features

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Automated data pipeline for ingesting and cleaning transaction data.
- **Fraud Detection Models**: Supervised (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) and Unsupervised (Clustering) models to detect fraud.
- **Model Deployment**: Dockerized machine learning models with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
- **Model Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard for real-time visualization of results.

## TODOs

1. Initial Setup
 - [ ] Clone the GitHub repository and set up the project locally.
 - [ ] Set up the environment using virtualenv/conda and install dependencies (requirements.txt).
2. Data Pipeline
 - [ ] Build the data ingestion pipeline (using Apache Airflow/Prefect).
 - [ ] Implement data validation and quality checks (using Great Expectations).
 - [ ] Set up DVC for versioning of datasets.
3. Feature Engineering
 - [ ] Preprocess the data (scaling, normalization, handling missing values).
 - [ ] Engineer additional features (transaction amount, time-based features, etc.).
4. Model Building
 - [ ] Implement Logistic Regression model.
 - [ ] Implement Decision Tree model.
 - [ ] Explore Neural Network models.
 - [ ] Implement Clustering for unsupervised detection of anomalies.
 - [ ] Evaluate models using cross-validation and calculate key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
5. MLOps Integration
 - [ ] Dockerize the models for consistent deployment.
 - [ ] Set up Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline to automate model training and deployment.
 - [ ] Use MLflow or DVC for model versioning and tracking.
6. Model Monitoring
 - [ ] Set up Prometheus to monitor model performance.
 - [ ] Visualize monitoring results using Grafana.
7. Dashboard
 - [ ] Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit/Dash.
 - [ ] Add visualizations for fraud detection rate, false positives, transaction categories, and prediction metrics.
8. Testing and Validation
 - [ ] Write unit tests for data pipeline and model scripts.
 - [ ] Conduct performance testing to ensure the pipeline handles large datasets.
9. Documentation
 - [ ] Document the codebase and provide explanations for each major component.
 - [ ] Add usage instructions for replicating the pipeline and model training.
10. Future Enhancements
 Add real-time data streaming using Kafka.
 Improve model explainability with SHAP/LIME.
